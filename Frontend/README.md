# Audiobook Frontend

This is the frontend for the Audiobook web application. The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application allows users to browse audiobooks, view detailed information about each audiobook, and submit reviews and ratings.

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>/frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

This will install all the necessary packages required for the project.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally:

1. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

```

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
- **src/components/**: Directory containing React components.
- **src/App.js**: The main application component.
- **src/index.js**: The entry point for the React application.

## Components

### AudiobookList

- Displays a list of audiobooks with basic details.
- Includes filters to sort and filter audiobooks based on genre, author, or rating.
- Links to the detailed view of each audiobook.

### AudiobookDetails

- Displays detailed information about an individual audiobook.
- Shows the title, author, genre, description, and cover image.
- Lists user reviews and ratings for the audiobook.
- Includes a form to submit new reviews.

### ReviewForm

- A form component that allows users to submit reviews and ratings for an audiobook.
- Includes fields for rating and comment.
- Submits the review data to the backend API.

## API Integration

The frontend interacts with the backend API to fetch and display audiobook data, as well as to submit reviews. The API endpoints used in the application include:

- `GET /api/audiobooks`: Retrieve a list of audiobooks with optional filters.
- `GET /api/audiobooks/:id`: Retrieve details for a specific audiobook.
- `POST /api/audiobooks/:id/reviews`: Submit a review for a specific audiobook.

## Styling

The application uses basic CSS for styling. You can enhance the styles by adding CSS files or using CSS-in-JS libraries such as styled-components.

## Deployment

To deploy the frontend application:

1. Build the application:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. The build folder will contain the production-ready files. You can deploy these files to a static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with installing dependencies, ensure that you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed.
- Check the browser console for any errors and debug accordingly.
- Ensure the backend server is running and accessible if you encounter issues with API requests.
